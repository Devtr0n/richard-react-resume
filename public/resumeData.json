    "bio":"I (Richard Hollon) am a 39 year old software engineer based in downtown Austin, Texas USA. I enjoy programming in the Microsoft stack: C#, PowerShell, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, HTML5, jQuery, Linq-to-EF, Web API 2/REST and SQL. I also advocate agile practices, continuous integration and domain driven design. I am an avid traveller, having most recently visited: New Orleans (Mardi Gras/Honeymoon), Budapest Hungary, Moscow Russia, Tbilisi Georgia, Athens Greece and Sochi/Krasnodar Russia. On March 3rd, 2019 I married the woman of my dreams at Mount Bonnell in Austin, Texas USA. In my free time I enjoy: playing my Martin guitar (a lefty), cooking different recipes (try me), cold-brewing coffee, bicycling Austin's trails and boardwalk, swimming, freshwater fishing, dove hunting, two-steppin' across Texas, editing vacation videos and so much more. This website was re-written in jQuery during some rare free time (Oct 2015). This website was updated (March 28th, 2019).",
